          <h4>OUR TRIALS</h4>
          <p>Here at Brainworks we have a number of trials taking place.While many trials are normally blinded at Brainworks presently we are not blinding trials. Our reason for this is that we want the patient to feel secure in knowing that the doctor is aware of their specific case
            making thier experience a more personable one. We can ensure you that this will not affect the trial outcome as the patient logs in normally at home and will complete any study or behavioural challenge that is necessary.
          </p>

          <h4>SURVEYS</h4>
          <p>When a patient agrees to take part in a study not only will they get an excellent mental health plan but they may be asked to take a survey.A survey can sometimes be used to give 
            an overall picture of how the patient is feeling at the start of the trail and can give an indication of the patients overall mental health.
          </p>

          <h4>GAMES</h4>
          <p>Many of the trials taking place here at Brainworks will use games and behavioural tests to understand aspects of the patients mental health. For more information on this particular aspect please feel free to talk to one of 
            coordinators.
